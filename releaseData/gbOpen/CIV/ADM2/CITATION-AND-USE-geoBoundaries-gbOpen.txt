The geoBoundaries database is made available in a 
variety of software formats to support GIS software programs.
This file is a part of the geoBoundaries Open Database 
(gbOpen).  All boundaries in this database are open and 
redistributable, and are released alongside extensive metadata 
and licence information to help inform end users. 
We update geoBoundaries on a yearly cycle, 
with new versions in or around August of each calendar 
year; old versions remain accessible at www.geoboundaries.org. 
The only requirement to use this data is to, with any use, provide
information on the authors (us), a link to geoboundaries.org or 
our academic citation, and the version of geoBoundaries used.

====================================================
Column Definitions
====================================================
boundaryID - A unique ID created for every boundary in the geoBoundaries database by concatenating ISO 3166-1 3 letter country code, boundary level, geoBoundaries version, and an incrementing ID.
boundaryISO -  The ISO 3166-1 3-letter country codes for each boundary.
boundaryYear - The year for which a boundary is representative.
boundaryType - The type of boundary defined (i.e., ADM0 is equivalent to a country border; ADM1 a state.  Levels below ADM1 can vary in definition by country.)
boundarySource-K - The name of the Kth source for the boundary definition used (with most boundaries having two identified sources).
boundaryLicense - The specific license the data is released under.
licenseDetail - Any details necessary for the interpretation or use of the license noted.
licenseSource - A resolvable URL (checked at the time of data release) declaring the license under which a data product is made available.
boundarySourceURL -  A resolvable URL (checked at the time of data release) from which source data was retrieved.
boundaryUpdate - A date encoded following ISO 8601 (Year-Month-Date) describing the last date this boundary was updated, for use in programmatic updating based on new releases.
downloadURL - A URL from which the geoBoundary can be downloaded.
shapeID - The boundary ID, followed by the letter `B' and a unique integer for each shape which is a member of that boundary.
shapeName - The identified name for a given shape.  'None' if not identified.
shapeGroup - The country or similar organizational group that a shape belongs to, in ISO 3166-1 where relevant.
shapeType - The type of boundary represented by the shape.
shapeISO - ISO codes for individual administrative districts, where available.  Where possible, these conform to ISO 3166-2, but this is not guaranteed in all cases. 'None' if not identified.
boundaryCanonical - Canonical name(s) for the administrative hierarchy represented.  Present where available.
